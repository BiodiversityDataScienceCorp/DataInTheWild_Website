Welcome! This course introduces students in the life sciences to data science through the application of quantitative reasoning and the R programming language to "real-world" problems. Students will follow a narrative set at an Antarctic colony and each module introduces them to basic programming, data visualization, statistics, machine learning, and interpretation of quantitative concepts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Module Descriptions

### **➤ MODULE 1: Mission Antarctica!**

A new effort to establish a permanent, sustainable colony in Antarctica is being launched. Students are introduced to the field of data science, the application (RStudio, RMarkdown, Jupyter Notebooks), and programming language (R, Python) used in the course.

### **➤ MODULE 2: Good Food Gone Bad**

There is a food poisoning outbreak among team members. Students use data visualization to determine where the problem lies (fish, not plants) and simulations to determine the root of the problem (fish tank density, not fish tank temperature).

### **➤ MODULE 3: Follow That Seal**

The fish tanks need to be restocked, but we want to avoid fishing in places with high leopard seal density, so we track the seals. However, the radio collars on leopard seals are failing and there is a deadly conflict between fish collectors and seals. The collars come from two different manufacturers, but we need to tell how the collars are failing (days to recharge, not signal distance) and how to classify collars of unknown provenance.

### **➤ MODULE 4: March of the Penguins**

A new road is needed to access fishing sites with low leopard seal density. There are several possible routes, but we want to avoid crossing through Gentoo penguin nesting grounds. Students will build models to determine predictors of nesting success, first with bootstrapping for confidence intervals, then with linear regression.

## Footnotes

The material is designed to be adaptable to other disciplines and serve as a template for your own courses. R was used as the primary programming language here, but the course is modifiable to other languages such as Python.
